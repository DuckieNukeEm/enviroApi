# enviroApi
an API that is built ontop of the enviropi envirment


THe bulk of the logic was already done via this repo: https://github.com/roscoe81/enviro-monitor/tree/master
However, becuase of the setup, it wasn't really friendly to easy modification, so parsing it into seperate files, and then building it ontop of it
